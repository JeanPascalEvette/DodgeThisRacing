## Contribution to the project

*Car physics:* the first part of the project was put a car model with physics working. Besides I didn´t have to be involved in this phase as I am a PT student, I considered that to be out of the central object
of a car game could affect my participation in later phases. For that I asked to be assigned some of the element of the car physics. In group we take the decision to follow a webpage where all the basic concepts
about the physics of a car are really good explained and make the conection between the different elements. The elements I implemented were:

- Slip Ratio: how much a wheel can roll when an automobile is moving. This elements has so many factors such as the angular velocity the wheel is rolling, the size of the wheel and the speed of the car that it´s 
different as the wheel one becase of the friction wit the floor. Some of this concepts have associated other calculations like the angular velocity that depends on the wheel inertia (calculated with the wheel mass
and radius) and bunch of that a car can experiment like the drive, brake and traction forces.

- Traction Force: it´s the force generated by the wheels when they are moving, using the friction and in opposite direction of the direction the wheel is moving. This concept is intimate related with the previous one
as it need the slip ratio to be calculated

- Torque on the wheels: it´s the force thet the road surface applies on the wheel surface. This force is opposed as the force of the engine one (drive torque) and the brake one has to be considered as wheel. Thus the
total torque in a wheel is the sum of this three forces.

*Collision Detection:* In the phase I was assigned to focus in the collision detection and how to make the different parts of the car to fall down. For the collision we´ve used 6 sphere colliders and we´ve associated 
detachable parts depending on the position of the sphere collider in the car. When we enter in the collision detection function we select randomly a part belonging the collider and we reduce the piece health depending
on the impact force. If the impact is big and the health is reduced to 0 we flag the detachable to fall down, getting out of the car. Always that the car impact follow the same process, if no pieces are left apart of
the core ones we only reduce the general health.

*Healt System:* In the third phase of the project I was assigned with all the health system of the game. That was in part related with the collision detection but also with the GUI part of it. I´ve never done slider 
before in Unity so it took some time to figure out how that worked. After all was implemented we decided to include two health bars in the game, one for in the corner with the number of lives and one above the car
so you can are double aware of the life you have.

## Problem Faced

*Car physics:* I did´t realised until I start looking for information and when we decide to follow a link where all the information about car physics were, how huge and how many single elements are involved to make
a really simple car model. We split the work between three people and one of the challenges was how to make all parts make sense as some parts were dependant of other person parts. The communication in this case was
key to check and explain other people work.

Other problem face with car physics is that the order of the elements is not always consistent and some concepts use the last frame status to be re-calculated making the calculation a little bit harder. Other factor
is that some of the elements are constant through the process and other ones change frame by frame depending on the car speed.

*Collision Detection:* once finished the collision detection and when we test with the cars we realised that the lateral impact frequently caused more damaged into the car that the frontal one. To fix that problem
we have to identify in which direction we have the impact and depending on the angle we apply a correction factor to reduce the damage if it´s a side collision.

## What worked well

*Facebook page:* the creation of a Facebook page where we share the outcome of any meetings, progress of the development and ask for other team members I think has been really useful. Due to the different schedules
and not being always able to attend the weekly meeting, that method was good to know what had been spoken in there and which task were assigned to who for the following week. Also sharing the progress, in particular,
the art part was good as often the group was checked for the teachers.

*Weekly meeting:* besides of the lack of a project manager that would have made the project more successful we agree from the beginning to have a couple of weekly meetings to share design doubts, plan the next week tasks
and check the status of the current ones. Also the meeting were a good moment to make team building outside the classes and know each other.

*Communication:* there was a clear barrier with the schedules of each person of the team, some of them working, some of them part timers, and different timetables, but in general I think the communication has been really
good the work between members collide in some point.

## What didn’t work well

*Use of Trello:* at the beginning we tried to use Trello to track the tasks and take a control of the elements done in the game. But soon and for the lack of someone updating it we stopped using it. The idea of use a tool
like that is beneficial when you work in a team but I firmly believe that someone has to dedicate some time to it and it´s not a pleasant task.

*Agendas:* as pointed before the team wasn´t homogeneous, having many par timers, people working at the same time they do the degree and few people full time dedicating lots of time to the project. So until we realised the 
implication of each member of the team cost us some time to figure out the task assignment depending on the disponibility of each person losing time to develop or focus on something else.

*Project Manager figure:* we definitely miss the figure of someone leading the project. JP did a great job organising and stepping forward in most of the cases but with someone dedicated to analise which are the requirements, 
defining in timeline plan, and organising the work between the different people of the team the final product would be better. In some of the cases I have the situation were I asked for design decision and few members replied 
to my questions. With this person leading the project the decision would be quick and straight forward.

## Improvements

- I would have put the meeting in a time of which all the members of the team could attent it doesn´t matter the method, in person, skype or video conference. I don´t think the people knew what others were doing every week
and having 1 hour of weekly meeting could also be beneficial as people could be involved in the design decisions and maybe aport ideas in each other parts.

- Game content and art work. I think including a wide variety of cars, and tracks could make the game experience to grow. The same way include new elements in the road or ways damage the opponents to make them lose can add great
value to the experience and make the people invest in the game.

## Conclusion
In general I think the outcome of the project it´s wonderful. Obviously there are things that can be improved or change but for the kind of project and the variety of team members we did a great job. Like starting point to 
make a playable game to be in a market store have funny things that can make the users to like it. I really enjoyed working with all members and I´ve learnt a lot during the game build process.
