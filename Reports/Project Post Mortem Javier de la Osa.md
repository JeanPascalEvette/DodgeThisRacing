## Contribution to the project

*Car physics:* the first part of the project was put a car model with physics working. Besides I didn´t have to be involved in this phase as I am a PT student, I considered that to be out of the central object
of a car game could affect my participation in later phases. For that I asked to be assigned some of the element of the car physics. In group we take the decision to follow a webpage where all the basic concepts
about the physics of a car are really good explained and make the conection between the different elements. The elements I implemented were:

- Slip Ratio: how much a wheel can roll when an automobile is moving. This elements has so many factors such as the angular velocity the wheel is rolling, the size of the wheel and the speed of the car that it´s 
different as the wheel one becase of the friction wit the floor. Some of this concepts have associated other calculations like the angular velocity that depends on the wheel inertia (calculated with the wheel mass
and radius) and bunch of that a car can experiment like the drive, brake and traction forces.

- Traction Force: it´s the force generated by the wheels when they are moving, using the friction and in opposite direction of the direction the wheel is moving. This concept is intimate related with the previous one
as it need the slip ratio to be calculated

- Torque on the wheels: it´s the force thet the road surface applies on the wheel surface. This force is opposed as the force of the engine one (drive torque) and the brake one has to be considered as wheel. Thus the
total torque in a wheel is the sum of this three forces.

*Collision Detection:* In the phase I was assigned to focus in the collision detection and how to make the different parts of the car to fall down. For the collision we´ve used 6 sphere colliders and we´ve associated 
detachable parts depending on the position of the sphere collider in the car. When we enter in the collision detection function we select randomly a part belonging the collider and we reduce the piece health depending
on the impact force. If the impact is big and the health is reduced to 0 we flag the detachable to fall down, getting out of the car. Always that the car impact follow the same process, if no pieces are left apart of
the core ones we only reduce the general health.

*Healt System:* In the third phase of the project I was assigned with all the health system of the game. That was in part related with the collision detection but also with the GUI part of it. I´ve never done slider 
before in Unity so it took some time to figure out how that worked. After all was implemented we decided to include two health bars in the game, one for in the corner with the number of lives and one above the car
so you can are double aware of the life you have.

## Problem Faced

*Car physics:* I did´t realised until I start looking for information and when we decide to follow a link where all the information about car physics were, how huge and how many single elements are involved to make
a really simple car model. We split the work between three people and one of the challenges was how to make all parts make sense as some parts were dependant of other person parts. The communication in this case was
key to check and explain other people work.

Other problem face with car physics is that the order of the elements is not always consistent and some concepts use the last frame status to be re-calculated making the calculation a little bit harder. Other factor
is that some of the elements are constant through the process and other ones change frame by frame depending on the car speed.

*Collision Detection:* once finished the collision detection and when we test with the cars we realised that the lateral impact frequently caused more damaged into the car that the frontal one. To fix that problem
we have to identify in which direction we have the impact and depending on the angle we apply a correction factor to reduce the damage if it´s a side collision.
