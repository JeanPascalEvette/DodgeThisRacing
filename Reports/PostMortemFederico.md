MSc. Computer Games & Entertainment – PT 1st year, 2016/17.

Assignment for Advanced Game Programming II.

**1) What you did on the project and what responsibilities you took on board on the team?**

In this project I worked in team with Elio De Bernardinis in the development of the Graphics User Interface of our racing game. We chose Nintendo’s Smash Brothers as a template for it, a system that in our opinion lent itself very well to a flexible and easy to use selection of game objects and players.
Both mine and Elio’s involvement was proportionate to our being first time part-time students in the course, so we did not take upon us any other programming tasks related to the Physics part, and we officially got on board one month into development, in accordance with the requirements of our status.
I created the basic scene system and framework for the GUI to be implemented, i.e. the LevelManager, which runs the Start and Menu scenes, and lets the players access the game once the car selection has been made.
I contributed to the PlayerSelector.cs and LevelManager.cs scripts, providing the basic functionality to switch players and car selections, upon which Elio has built further layers of complexity.
I contributed to the conception of the GUI design and principles, which we agreed upon in collaboration with the other team members.
I provided some graphics and font design for the start menu and a musical loop before the game starts.

**2) Details of some of the challenges you faced and how you dealt with them (i.e. your approach to resolving any technical or artistic challenges you faced)**

Most of the technical challenges were due to the intricacies of having two people working on the same code base and the same scripts, essentially duplicating the same tasks in few occasions. We resolved this by working on separate GitHub branches on the same problems and then either merging or continuing from a single branch. This approach could have been streamlined and created an excess of branching in my opinion.
There were difficulties, as often happens in software development, in the naming of variables and functions, and also in the consistency of the naming standards. We resolved this by allowing the code to be heavily commented, more than it would normally be, privileging therefore communication among us rather than worrying too much about legacy code.
Another technical challenge I personally faced was my pc’s inability to support the controllers that we used to test the GUI. I have tried several - including Xbox, Steam Controller and PS4 – but I have eventually done all the tests on the Nintendo controllers that my teammate used, and on my keyboard. Possibly it may have been an issue with Windows 7, but I didn’t want to risk a major upgrade to Windows 10 in the middle of assignments and with a looming deadline.

**3) Areas of your project which you felt went to plan - things you were particularly pleased about. These could be technical accomplishments, team achievements, great communication, good self-critique & team reviews, efficient task planning etc.**

I think the coding went quite well, despite some difficulties with bugs and testing, as mentioned above. Team communication, in the narrower terms of my teammate Elio, was smooth and efficient, we quickly resolved any conflicts that we may have had, and carried on the project with a sustained pace. Task were planned in a loose manner, but effectively in the end. The most important and satisfying part was to be able to successfully replicate, although with evident limitations, a Graphic User Interface inspired by a well-known videogame: Nintendo’s Smash Bros.
It was satisfying to produce a sophisticated and well-designed piece of software even for an aspect of the game that is ancillary to the game functionality. Working on the GUI such as we did presented some sizeable challenges, since we wanted to make it as user friendly and close to AAA standards as possible. It was therefore very rewarding to have succeeded in creating it.
Speaking of the project at large, I think the artwork has produced quite good results, the four cars all have distinct and peculiar features, which give the game an odd and original feeling. The camera movements have also an interesting change of perspective along the tracks, which confer a fluid and dynamic rhythm to the game.
Personally I am also happy to have improved my knowledge of the Unity 3D engine tools and C# scripting.

**4) Areas which didn't go quite as well as anticipated - problem areas, tasks which took longer than planned, roadblocks, pipeline issues etc.**

It seems that assuming double duties for a narrow aspect such as GUI may have created some bottlenecks and uncertainty on task distribution. There have been circumstances when we were both working on the same thing, essentially competing to get the same thing done, and I feel like time could have been spent more efficiently with better management. Design principles were discussed very early on, and perhaps an update or a revision could have helped improve the overall interface and facilitate the work.
As a whole, I think the game project, in all its units, could have benefitted from a better management of time and resources. Scheduling meetings twice per week, a schemed that we tried to maintain in the first month of development, proved too rigid to be productive amongst many other lectures and deadlines. As the group was split between part-time and full time students, several conflicting agendas emerged, due to factors such as long commuting distances and part-time work outside the University.
I also think a project of this scope was perhaps too big an undertaking in such a busy University schedule. It seems to me that it would have been better suited for a team that could allocated more energy and resources to development. In particular, the game design and mechanic should have had more iterations and refinements.
In general, the project showed a certain lack of interaction between sections and needed a unifying vision. Once again, that was partly due to lack of resolution on the project management approach and also possibly to people’s busy University and work schedules, that didn’t allow for properly allocated development time.

**5) What you'd do different next time - i.e. what did you learn and how would you go about processes or collaborative efforts differently next time? e.g. Task tracking was an issue, so next time we'd use a backlog.**

Speaking of the project as a whole, there are several lessons learnt. A very positive one is that open and honest collaboration always yields results, so people and talent are always going to be the most important thing. I have to also recognize that managing talent is equally as important as having talent at hand. There were undoubtedly some management issues, both relative in our GUI subgroup and in the project at large. I think it is important to decide on a project management approach early on, while sometimes there is a tendency only to talk about it and to “just do things”, but that approach may work or it may not, depending on the individuals, and also it varies when people are not working for a single entity but
have many other things, jobs, assignments to do. For future projects I will make it a point of appointing a project manager and establishing project management principles that the entire team should follow.
To communicate among us we used Trello, a productivity tool, but mostly a Facebook group we created for the project. Despite its portability and simplicity for everyone, its mobility and availability on every device, I think precious information has been lost and professional communication is not best done via a Facebook group. I would like to use tools such as Slack, which is currently one of the most widely endorsed productivity applications in the software industry. Slack takes the entire conversation – including assets, prototypes, pieces of code, etc. – into a single location. It also provides the possibility to create specific channels – e.g. art channels, software channel – where team members can discuss their own topic of interest. I think our project would have largely benefitted from something of that kind, and I would encourage any future collaborator to adopt it.
In further projects, I would take a more flexible approach when creating a working schedule. In light of our experience, I think it should take into account individuals availability and specific contributions. It is also possible that the time in the meetings could have simply been allocated better, going back to it being a project management issue. Either way, I would be open to experiment with flexibility and to using all the available tools to make the best out of each team member’s contribution possibilities and time.
